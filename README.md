Given an int array called nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the order of the other elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array, that is, you must modify the given array without creating a new one.

 Examples:
   {0, 1, 0, 3, 12} -> {1, 3, 12, 0, 0}
   {22, 0, 10, 0, 9, 0, 12, 0} -> {22, 10, 9, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0}
   {0,0,0,0,0,0,1} -> {1,0,0,0,0,0,0}
   {22,0,0} -> {22,0,0}  
   {0} -> {0}
